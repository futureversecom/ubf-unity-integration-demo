## ‚ùì What is UBF? What does it mean to 'run a blueprint'?

<p>'UBF' is an acronym for "Universal Blueprint Framework". It encompasses a set of tools used to render objects across different engines and platforms.

  This starts with the creation of a 'blueprint' - a set of instructions to render your asset. You can create blueprints using the 'UBF Studio' tool. 

Blueprints are then stored with whatever resources (such as models or textures) that are required to run the blueprint. 
Finally, an experience (such as this project!) can download that blueprint and its resources, parse them, and run them to render the asset.</p>

<p>This 'demo integration' project will show you how easy it is to begin rendering the wide variety of blueprints and assets that are already present in the Futureverse ecosystem.

  We do this using the tools that have been provided to interact with Futureverse systems. 
- The Futurepass SDK allows us to use a custodial login pipeline to 'log in' to Futureverse and access our assets. 
- The Sylo SDK provides the functionality to access decentralised asset storage.
- The Asset Registry SDK gives the tools to query the Asset Registry, a database of assets and their details such as ownership, storage location and metadata. </p>

## üè° Scene Layout - Main Scene
The "Main Scene" scene is the primary touchpoint for using the UBF Integration Demo. It contains all the functionality needed to render a game ready UBF asset and can be found in the "Assets/Scenes" folder.

The following is a list of significant objects and components within the scene, and should serve as a touch-point for you to investigate the scene. 
Feel free to skip forward to the 'Getting Started' section if you prefer to experience runtime functionality first!
<br><br>

<ul>
  
### Environment / Main Camera
Includes the 3D models and colliders for the level geometry.

---
### Player Objects 
Contains a cinemachine camera target for the player, and also a 'Player Armature'. The armature contains an animator, character controller and UBF Runtime Controller; everything we need to render an animated character.

---
### Controllers -> Experience Controller
This component is the primary controller for scene logic, connecting the functionality between UI, UBF, authentication and AR systems.

---
### Controllers -> Execution Controller
This component is the scene object used for retrieving and executing Asset Registry (AR) UBF graphs. It executes queries, builds context trees and forwards them to the Runtime Controller for execution.

---
### UI
This object tree contains all the UI needed for scene interaction, including authentication / wallet entry, an asset grid for object selection and version information text.
</ul>

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: Rendering an Asset via Futurepass Wallet

// TODO sort staging wallet
// TODO progress pictures

UBF is designed to allow users to render any compatible blueprint across a variety of engines and platforms. 
So, to begin, lets render a simple jacket asset. 

First, ensure you have the "Main Scene" open, as this is where we will run our test. The MonoClient and ExperienceController components should both have their Environment set to Staging.

Start your scene with the play button at the top of the editor, and when presented with the option, select "Enter Pass Address". This allows us to load assets from a specific wallet without the full custodial login process. Enter the wallet as follows: 
`0xFffffFFF00000000000000000000000000043d70`

Press 'Enter' when you have finished entering the wallet and you will now see our program load the wallets assets. 
On the left, you will see a grid begin to populate. Many, if not all, assets have images associated with them for easy viewing. However, some of these are in the .webp format, which will render as white (a known unity issue). 

Using the wallet above, you will see a 'jacket' item. If you click on this the UBF controller will begin to load that jacket for us to see. It will take a variable amount of time to appear depending on your internet connection: the blueprint and its resources are being downloaded from the Asset Registry and pieced together right in front of us. 


```cs
// todo
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: Runtime Animation

// TODO pictures
// TODO formatting

One of the great features of UBF is the ability to render and animate humanoid models out of the box. 
To showcase this, we are going to look at rendering an asset from an existing UBF collection inside our demo. 

We are going to follow a very similar process to the above 'Rendering an Asset' tutorial. 
Navigate to the main scene, and play. Enter the wallet: `0xFffffFFF00000000000000000000000000043d70`
Once the assets have loaded in the grid, you will see some are humanoid: bears, rabbits (flufs) and goblins. 
For this demonstration, select one the bear assets to render. 

Once it has loaded, you will notice that it is using an idle animation! Using your mouse and keyboard, you can run around with your bear, showcasing the different animations being blended.

Now that we have seen the end result, lets go over the process. 

The bear belongs to a collection of assets named 'Partybears'. The body of a partybear is a GLB model with a UBF fur shader applied, and that is what you see being rendered. The GLB model of that bear is 'rigged' to a skeleton. This skeleton is made in a fashion to be compatible with unity humanoid systems. However, Unity cannot just detect this out of the box. This is why we use the UBF 'Mesh Config' system. 

Mesh Configs allow us to setup a pre-existing data object in the project that can provide Unity with all the details it needs to animate the incoming GLB. It takes two variables: a runtime prefab, and a humanoid avatar. 

The runtime prefab is a Unity prefab that contains the skeleton to animate. An advantage of using the prefab architecture is that should you wish to add sockets or game logic, this is an easy place to do so. In the test case for our Partybears, the rig prefab just contains our basic bear skeleton. 

A humanoid avatar, or Unity avatar, contains the details of what bones from the bear skeleton should be matched up to the associated Unity humanoid bone. This allows the animator to translate a standard humanoid animation onto our spawned GLB model. 

These elements combined allow a procedurally spawned GLB object to be animated using the Unity humanoid animation system.

To view the MeshConfig for the Partybear collection, navigate to Assets/Collections/Data in the Project panel. Selecting the MC_Partybear asset, you will be able to locate what assets were used for its rig prefab, and humanoid avatar. 

To create a new MeshConfig, you can duplicate an existing one, or right-click in the project panel and navigate to /Create/UBF/Mesh Config.

Once a Mesh Config data asset has been created, it must be registered with the UBF settings in the experience. To view the UBF settings, open Project Settings and navigate to the UBF section. 
In this section you can see a Mesh Config array that holds all the registered configurations. Note that each config has a 'key'. This key matches what is set inside the graph that is running. When the Partybear graph runs, it executes a 'CreateMeshConfig' with a key of "PartyBear_BodyMesh". The experience finds the matching config from these settings and provides it.

When the blueprint renders a new mesh, it will also instantiate a copy of the config's runtime prefab. All of the meshes rendered with that config will then 'retarget', and use the bones of this prefab instead of the rig that is embedded in the glb itself. Once it has done this, it will attempt to find an animator in the parent objects of the rendered mesh. If it can find one, it will set the avatar of that animator to the avatar retrieved from the config file. 

In short, the Mesh Config system will:
1. Create a runtime rig with preset game logic,
2. Retarget meshes spawned at runtime to this rig, and
3. Setup an animator with the correct avatar.

With this done, the animator is now compatible with any humanoid animations used in the AnimationController.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: The Authentication Pipeline

As explored in previous steps, this demonstration project has two methods to retrieve a users wallet; the user may enter their wallet directly, or they may use the 'custodial authentication' pipeline. 
This experience only uses the wallet that is provided from either step, but it is useful to understand the advantages of the authentication process. 

When performing the authentication process, the experience is able to access and store more information from the user, including their wallet, an access token, a refresh token, and even elements such as the users email. These elements can be used to verify that the user is the true owner of the futurepass address provided. Also, the access token is compatible with many other futurepass systems that require authentication. This may include Asset Registry operations (equipping items such as clothing), or accessing data from a Sylo. 

Further details surrounding the Unity Futurepass SDK can be found [here](https://github.com/futureversecom/sdk-unity-futurepass)

The implementation of this SDK in this project is very straightforward. The project calls "FuturepassAuthentication.StartLogin" from the ExperienceController.cs, which starts the process of logging in, and returns the result to the controller via callback, as below:

```cs
private void OnLoginClicked()
{
    loginText.text = "Connecting...\n";
        
    // Start custodial authentication process
    Auth.StartLogin(() =>
    {
        loginText.text += "Logged in!";
        wallet = Auth.LoadedAuthenticationDetails.DecodedToken.Futurepass;
        Debug.Log("Logged in with wallet: " + wallet);
        loggedIn = true;
    }, exception =>
    {
        loginText.text += "Failed to login!\n";
        loginText.text += exception.Message + '\n';
    });
}
```
